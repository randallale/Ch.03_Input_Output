HONOR CODE: I solemnly promise that while taking this test I will only use PyCharm or the Internet,
but I will definitely not ask another person except the instructor. Signed: Alexander Randall



1. Write a line of code that will print your name.
'''
print("Alexander Randall")

'''
2. How do you enter a comment in a program?
'''
# use a hashtag

'''
3. What is the ouput of the following lines of code?
print (2/3)
print (2//3)
'''
#the first one is .66
#the second one is 0

'''
4. Write a line of code that creates a variable called pi and sets it to an
appropriate value.

'''
pi = 3.14

'''
5. Why does this code not work?
A=22
print(a)
'''
# the variable a is not defined but the variable A is


'''
6. All of the variable names below can be used. But which of these is the best?
a
A
Area
AREA
area
areaOfRectangle
AreaOfRectangle
'''
#areaofrectangle because it is specific and doesnt start with a capital

'''
7. Which of these variables names are not allowed in Python?
apple
Apple
APPLE
Apple2
1Apple
account number
account_number
account.number
accountNumber
account#
'''
#1Apple doesnt work
#account number doesnt work
#account.number doesnt work
#account# doesn't work


'''
8. Why does this code not work?

print(a)
a=45
'''
#this code doesn't work because its asking to print the variable before the variable is defined


'''
9. Write a line of code that will ask the user for the length of a square's
side and store the result in a variable. Make sure to convert the value
to an integer.
'''
side = int(input("What's the length of the square's side?"))

'''
10. Write a line of code that prints the area of the square, using the
number the user typed in that you stored in question 9.
'''
print(side**2)


'''11. Do the same as in questions 9 and 10, but with the formula for the
area of an ellipse. Area=pi*a*b where a and b are the lengths of the major radii.
'''
a = int(input("What's the length of the radii?"))
b = int(input("What's the length of the other radii?"))
print(pi*a*b)


'''
12. Do the same as in questions 9 and 10, but with a formula to find
the pressure of a gas. PV=nRT where n is the number of moles, T is the absolute temperature, V is the
volume, and R is the gas constant 8.3144.
'''


'''
13. Explain the mistake in this code:

pi = float(3.14)
'''



'''
14. Assume radius has been defined. This code runs, but isn't very good. Explain the mistake in the following code:

x=3.14
pi=x
area=pi*radius**2
'''


'''
Assuming x and y are already defined, this code runs. But
something isn't quite right. Explain the mistake in the following code:

a=((x)*(y))
'''


'''
16. Explain the mistake in the following code:

radius = input(float("Enter the radius:"))
'''
